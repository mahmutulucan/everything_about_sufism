# Contributing to **Everything About Sufism**
Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Everything About Sufism**! We greatly appreciate any help in improving the platform, whether it's through bug fixes, new features, documentation updates, or other enhancements. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

## How to Contribute
### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Create a New Branch
Next, create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your contributions separate from the main project. Use a descriptive name for your branch, for example:
`feature/add-new-topic` or `bugfix/fix-broken-link`

### 3. Make Your Changes
Now, make your changes in the new branch. Be sure to follow the coding style of the project and write clear, concise commit messages explaining the purpose of your changes.

### 4. Test Your Changes
There might not be tests in place yet, but it is highly recommended to add tests when introducing new features or bug fixes. You can reach out to the project owner for guidance on the testing framework and how to write tests for the project.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them. Ensure your commit message is clear and follows this structure:
`<type>(<scope>): <message>`
Example:
```bash
feat(user-profile): add ability to upload profile picture
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository. In the PR description, clearly explain your changes and why they should be merged. Make sure to link to any relevant issues.
